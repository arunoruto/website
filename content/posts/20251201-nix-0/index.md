My Nix journey started back in summer 2023. I was drawn to the idea of a declarative system and keeping my configurations neatly on GitHub. The fact that Nix has the largest package repository sealed the deal for me.

So, I just yoloed it: I wiped Fedora from my Framework laptop, my main machine, and installed NixOS. The initial plan was to take it slow, just installing packages and exploring things one step at a time.

To be honest, it wasn't always a smooth ride. Some problems really tested my patience, but I was determined to see it through.

Now, more than two years later, I'm a very happy NixOS user. I've had the chance to go to two NixCons and have become a contributor to the ecosystem myself. I'm a maintainer for a few packages and services in [`nixpkgs`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) and have recently contributed to [`home-manager`](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) and [`stylix`](https://github.com/nix-community/stylix) as well.

I’ve learned a lot, and now I want to help you have an easier start. This tutorial series is how I would approach learning Nix if I could start all over again.

This will be also a personal endeavor to document my knowledge somewhere. Especially since the Nix documentation isn't really that centralized and I want a place for my thoughts to be gathered!

Let's get started.
